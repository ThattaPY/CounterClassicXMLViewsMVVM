# CounterClassicXMLViewsMVVM
This app is a simply MVVM demo of my skills
the app has made in 5 hours

The code uses best practices
dimens and strings in their respective .xml
presenter-domain-data folders, following MVVM archt
The app uses the repository pattern 
I enforce in create a low dependency classes
Room uses, singleton pattern
The async is made with coroutines
The app uses a class that extends from Application()
this class control over the app lifecycle the coroutines scopes
and create an instance of repository to use in a global scope
In domain layer we found uses-cases that isolates the bussiness-logic
